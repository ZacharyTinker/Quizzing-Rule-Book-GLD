## Guidelines

A quizzer may accept only 1 scholarship award each season if he or she is a winner in more than 1 category. The scholarship of highest value will be awarded. This restriction does not apply to the Floyd Meier Scholarship.

A quizzer may earn a new scholarship at each season's IBQ, thereby accumulating scholarships.

All college-financed scholarships will be equally divided between fall and spring semesters.

All quizzers who have received scholarships must begin using their scholarships within 2 years of graduating from high school.

Awards and scholarship amounts will be announced annually. In addition to these scholarships, Alliance colleges may also offer additional scholarships to international, district, and local participants. Please contact the individual colleges for details.

## Scope

This policy provides a collaborative framework for the development and governance of *Christian and Missionary Alliance* (CMA) *Bible Quizzing* (BQ). It is intended to suggest a means by which quizzing and quizzing events can be promoted and coordinated. The policy assigns matters of program, policy, and procedure to a leadership team. Responsibilities for logistical support remain with the Life Office for the CMA.

## CMA Quizzing Leadership Team (CQLT)

A CMA leadership team will give oversight to quizzing and coordinate policies and procedures in both Canada and the United States as follows:

### Responsibilities

The CQLT will promote, coordinate, and provide general oversight for Alliance Bible Quizzing including but not limited to:

- Finding ways that quizzing can support and integrate into local church, district, and national ministries
- Promoting and growing quizzing in districts in Canada and the United States
- Developing and maintaining uniform policies, including choice of translation
- Facilitating the provision of resources to strengthen quizzing (including coordinating question writing, editing, distributing the same)
- Developing and managing an annual program budget
- Planning and giving oversight to the International Quizzing Competition
- Facilitating communications among quizzing leadership
- Maintaining records and databases as necessary
- To establish task groups as necessary

### Composition

The CQLT shall consist of 6 persons; with no more than 1 representative from any 1 district, if possible, chosen from among the district team leaders and/or adult coaches of district quizzing teams.

At least 2 members of the CQLT shall be chosen from Canadian team coaches and at least 2 members shall be chosen from among U.S. team coaches to ensure the interests of Alliance churches and districts in each country are represented.

A maximum of 2 non-Alliance members can be voted onto the CQLT with a maximum of 1 per election. Nominations follow the same approval process as listed in the election section below.

The director of the Life Office shall serve ex officio as a resource to the leadership team to coordinate programming and appropriate support for the International Quizzing Competition. The national youth director of each country or an equivalent representative may participate in any meeting of the CQLT.

### Term

Members serve for a 3-year term with the possibility of 2 consecutive terms. Members serving consecutive terms will experience a gap of at least 1 year before being eligible for re-election. The Life Office director and national youth directors, who serve ex officio as a non-voting member are exempt from a gap year.

### Election

An election for team members shall be held annually. Normally 2 new members will be elected each year.

Each district may nominate a person for the CQLT and the CQLT will create a short list of 2 names per vacancy for elections unless fewer names are nominated. Nominees must have the approval of the District quizzing point person, the District Superintendent or his appointee and the nominee's pastor. Ballots will be sent to every district quiz program. Each participating district shall be entitled to 1 vote for each vacancy. If a representative is needed from 1 country, then the person from that country with the highest vote will be elected followed by the person with the highest number of votes.

### Meetings

Normally the CQLT will meet 3 times annually, with at least 1 face to face meeting.

### Chair

The CQLT will annually elect a member to serve as chair.

### Amendments

Any amendment to the Alliance Bible Quizzing rule book must be approved by a majority of the members of the CQLT.

## Life Office

The Life Office shall provide logistical support for the International Quizzing Competition and the director will provide operational oversight of the event.

The Life Office will:

- Recommend venues for the international competition to the CQLT for approval
- Coordinate the international quizzing event and act as the sole liaison between the CQLT and the staff of the venue
- Provide bookkeeping services, including billing and paying expenses for the CQLT as requested

## Budget and Finance

The CQLT shall prepare a balanced annual programming budget including the International Quizzing event, operational expenses and fees for Life Office services. A copy of the budget shall be forwarded to the Vice President Nurture and Development in Canada and the Vice President for U.S. Church Ministries for their information. The CQLT shall provide annual financial reports to each CMA national office and each district quizzing program.

## Amenability

The CQLT and Life Office is amenable to the Vice President for Church Ministries in the United States.

### Budget Guidelines

International quiz meet registration fees are intended to cover the costs of the meet including venue development and administrative support. If the international quiz meet is held in a "low cost" location, registration fees may generate a modest surplus which is to be used to offset "high cost" venues in future years.

Additional funds are necessary for the CQLT to fulfill its proposed responsibilities. In addition to CMA start up grants, additional annual sources of income must be identified. Any yearly surplus in CQLT funds will be carried forward to use for quizzing development in future years.

The CQLT will be responsible for developing and managing a balanced annual budget and for distributing annual financial reports to the quizzing districts.

# Best Practices

The following are best practices.

## Questions

- All questions are checked for accuracy, construction, and distribution prior to the quiz.

## Quizmaster

The quizmaster should:

- Be thoroughly acquainted with all rules, procedures, and material of that quiz season.
- Be impartial and render decisions consistently.
- See that all officials are briefed regarding rules and procedures.
- Read at a normal conversation rate. Hesitating or reading too quickly must be avoided since either may cause inaccurate quizzing.
    - Read all questions at the same rate of speed with the ability to stop reading the question at the exact moment a jump is made.
- Keep the quiz moving at a consistent pace. A quiz should not be rushed, but it is important to maintain the quickest pace which does not interfere with accuracy.
- Be open to a challenge and be willing to evaluate whatever the captains or co-captains feel is in error.
- Facilitate a positive, uplifting environment throughout the quiz. Quizmasters should speak clearly and be enthusiastic about quizzing. To this end, quizzers should be called by name, the score should be announced often (when a scoreboard is not present), and bonuses and quiz-outs should be promptly recognized.

## Answer Judge

- Will check the 2011 NIV scripture when asked to verify the accuracy of the written answer.
- May call a foul or rule infraction related to jumping.

## Quote/Finish

- Must be strong enough to stand on its own without requiring additional verses to explain it.
- Must be spiritually significant and significant to the chapter.

### Finish 2 Verses/Quote 2 Verses

- Should be verses that make more sense when quoted together.

#### Example

Example: Gal 5:22-23

### Finish This/Finish This and the Next

FTV questions should not start with an insignificant introduction such as "He replied" or "He said to them". These verses, if spiritually significant, should be used as FT or FTN type questions. For example, Luke 11:28 says, He replied, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it." This verse could be used as an excellent FT question starting with "Blessed rather are those who...".

## Situation

Situation quotations must be reasonable in length.

## Overtime

If the score in overtime is such that the final placements are decided, the current set of 3 overtime questions does not have to be completed.

### Example

Some common cases of districts setting their own rules:

- Using team jumping bonus questions instead of assigned seat bonus questions.
- Not breaking ties during prelim quizzes

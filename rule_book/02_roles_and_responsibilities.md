# Roles and Responsibilities

## Team Organization

A team can consist of up to 5 quizzers. Teams can have up to 4 quizzers seated in a quiz at any given time.

### Captains

Scorekeepers must be notified which quizzer is the captain and which is co-captain before the quiz begins. The captain and co-captain may change during a given competition but not during a quiz.

Only the captain or co-captain may appeal a decision or respond to an appeal. If both the captain and co-captain have erred-out, another quizzer can be designated by the coach to respond to or initiate appeals.

## Quiz Officials

No comment other than "correct" or "incorrect" need be announced by the quiz officials when announcing a ruling; however, at the discretion of the *quizmaster* (QM) and *answer judge* (AJ), or at the request of the captain, additional information may be given.

If the additional information regarding the ruling is provided at the discretion of the QM/AJ and not at the request of the captain, this is not considered an explanation of a ruling, which would invalidate an appeal or review.

If the captain requests additional information regarding the ruling, this is considered an explanation of a ruling and invalidates an appeal or review. Before replying to a request for an explanation, the QM must ask all teams if they wish to appeal.

All conferring between quizmaster and answer judge(s) shall be done privately.

### Quizmasters (QM)

The quizmaster must:

- Maintain a position such that all currently seated quizzers are able to view the quizmaster's face
- Speak in such as a way to be understood by all quizzers
- Rule immediately upon an obviously correct or incorrect answer if there is no indication from the answer judge to the contrary

When a quizzer's response contains a required completion of the question and that completion is different than the written question, the quizmaster will discuss it with the answer judge. If the quizzer gives a reference question that is different than the written question, the quizmaster and answer judge must ensure that the reference question given is the exact same type as the written question.

The quizmaster should consult with the answer judge(s) at any time they feel is necessary, provided it does not infringe upon the quizzer's answering period.

#### Quizmaster Prompts

During the answering period, the quizmaster will prompt the quizzer in the following ways. If the quizmaster has given a prompt that is clear and is in keeping with the spirit of these rules even if not word for word, it is acceptable as long as the occasion for the prompt is still correct.

##### Clarify

If a quizzer has provided all the information in the question and answer, except the identification of a pronoun present which is part of the answer text, the quizmaster will prompt the quizzer to identify the specific pronoun. For example: "Can you clarify 'He'?" or "Clarify 'They.'"

The quizmaster is not allowed to say anything other than what the quizzer has already said when asking for the identification. A pronoun may need to be identified only if the antecedent is in context.

##### What is your reference?

On a Quote or Reference type question, if the quizmaster did not finish saying the entire reference before the quizzer jumped, then the quizmaster will prompt for the reference. For example: "What is your reference?" or "Your reference?".

##### What is your question?

On a Reference type question, if the quizzer has given all the information in both the question and the answer and the complete question was not read, the quizmaster will prompt for the question. For example: "What is your question?" or "Question?".

##### Again

On a Quote or Finish type question, once the quizzer has quoted to the end of the required verse or verses, if the answer is not yet word-perfect, the quizmaster will say, "Again." This will occur as often as needed until the quizzer's answer is word-perfect or the answering period expires. The quizmaster is not allowed to say "Again" until the quizzer has come to the end of the verse, each time through, as this would give the quizzer information about where their mistake was made.

##### Quote is Complete

On a Situation type question, when the quizzer has completed the quotation, the quizmaster will tell the quizzer that the quote is finished. For example: "Quote is complete" or "That is the quote."

#### Commentary

On a CVR/CVRMA, in the scenario where the entire reference (which is part of the question text) was not read by the quizmaster, the quizmaster has 2 prompts to give, and must give them in correct order and with correct timing. If the quizzer provides all information in the question text and the answer text, because the quizzer has not yet finished saying the complete reference, which is part of the question, the quizmaster must prompt with "What is your reference?" The quizmaster cannot prompt with "What is your question?" yet, because the quizzer has not provided all information in the question (which includes the reference) and the answer.

### Answer Judges (AJ)

When an answer given is in question, the answer judge will determine whether the answer given meets the requirements of a correct answer and make a ruling recommendation to the quizmaster.

Answer judges will also:

- Watch the quizmaster's reading for accuracy
- Ensure the quizzer is recognized by the quizmaster when their light comes on

### Scorekeepers (SK)

The scorekeeper will:

- Tally and immediately announce when a quizzer has erred-out, quizzed-out, or fouled-out
- Keep a record of all timeouts
- Keep a record of the number of questions a substitute quizzer has remained out to determine eligibility for re-substitution
- Either read the score or have the score ready to be read at the beginning of timeouts when there is no scoreboard
- Have the scoresheets signed by the coaches at the conclusion of each quiz and report to the statistician

### Statisticians (ST)

The statistician will be responsible for:

- Keeping individual quizzers' scores
- Keeping individual teams' scores

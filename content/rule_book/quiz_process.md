# Quiz Process

The process for running a quiz includes topics like types of quizzes, question type distribution, and how a quiz progresses outside specific quiz events.

**Quiz Question**
: Every component of a question within the context of a quiz including all components of a written question along with quiz context such as question number

**Number**
: The full identification of which question a given question is within a quiz, which can be purely a numeric or an alphanumeric

**Numeric**
: A question number with only numbers such as 17

**Alphanumeric**
: A question number with numbers and letters such as 17A

**Read Question**
: Everything the quizmaster reads from the quiz question

**Answer**
: Everything the quizzer says while answering a question after being recognized by the quizmaster until their question answer duration period has elapsed or being called correct or incorrect

**Response**
: A synonym for answer

## Questions

There will be no duplicate questions in a single quiz.

**Participating in a Question**
: A team that is eligible to jump on a given question is said to be participating in a question. A team that has no quizzers eligible to jump because of either foul-out, err-out, or quiz-out is still considered a team that is eligible to jump.

### Toss-Up Questions

When 3 teams are participating in a question and 1 team errs, the next question will be a toss-up question for the 2 teams that did not err on the previous question. The team that erred is ineligible to jump on the toss-up question.

If only 2 teams were participating in a question and 1 team errs, the next question will be a bonus question, not a toss-up question. If only 1 team was participating in a question, it must have been a bonus question. As such, any outcome of the bonus question results in all 3 teams participating in the next question.

### Bonus Questions

If only 2 teams are participating in a question and 1 team errs, the next question will be an assigned bonus question for the team that did not err. An assigned bonus question is awarded to the corresponding chair of the chair that erred on the toss-up.

#### Example

There are 4 chairs per team, any 1 of which may be filled or empty. If the quizzer seated on chair 2 erred on the toss-up, the quizzer seated on chair 2 of the team that did not err on the toss-up will be awarded the bonus question. If no quizzer of the team that did not err on the toss-up is seated in chair 2, then the bonus is "for an empty seat" and considered a no jump.

### Question Reading Structure

A quizmaster must introduce and read each question type in a specific, multipart way:

1. Question introduction
    - State the full question number and type

        > "Question number [question number] is a [type] question."

    - Include whether it's a toss-up or bonus question

        > "It is a ["toss-up" or "bonus"] for [team(s)]."

    - For situation questions only, include the question's interrogatives

        > "I need to know [Situation question interrogatives]."

2. Call the question

    > "Question number [question number], question:"

3. Question text or remainder of question text

A quizmaster may repeat or repeat as a paraphrase any component of the question introduction for additional clarity.

## Types of Quizzes

There are 3 primary types of quizzes and 2 related overtime components of quizzes.

### Logic

    Set quiz types to
        "3-Team 20-Question", "2-Team 15-Question Tie-Breaker",
        "2-Team 20-Question", "2-Team Overtime", and "3-Team Overtime".

### 3-Team 20-Question Quiz

There will be 20 numeric questions in a quiz, excluding any overtime questions.

A toss-up question is the result of an error by 1 team. The 2 remaining teams will have the opportunity to jump, but the team making the error is ineligible for that question. If question 1 to 15 is erred, the next question will be a numbered question and a toss-up question. If question 16-20 is erred, the next question will be a toss-up appended with A. For example, if 3 teams were participating on 16, the toss-up question will be question 16A.

Regarding bonus questions:

- If toss-up question 2 through 15 is erred, then the next question number is a bonus question
- If question 16 is a toss-up question and is erred, 16A is a bonus question
- If 16A through 20A is a toss-up and is erred, then 16B through 20B is a bonus question

### 2-Team 15-Question Tie-Breaker Quiz

A 2-team 15-question tie-breaker quiz operates much like a 3-team 20-question quiz except:

- There will be 15 numeric questions in a quiz
- If an error occurs on questions 1 through 11, the next question number is a 20-point bonus question
- If questions 12 through 15 are erred, the bonus question will remain on the same question number and will not be counted in the basic 15 questions; both teams must jump on questions 13 through 15
- All bonus questions up to and including 12B are worth 20 points
- All bonus questions from 13 to the end of the quiz are worth 10 points
- A quiz-out is 3 correct questions

Points deduction for every error on a question or toss-up question start at question number 13 instead of question number 17.

### 2-Team 20-Question Quiz

A 2-team 20-question quiz operates much like a 3-team 20-question quiz except:

- All questions have a value of 20 points when 2 teams are eligible
- If questions 1-15 are erred, the next question will be a bonus question
- If questions 16-20 are erred, 16A-20A will be a bonus question
- All bonus questions throughout the whole quiz are 10 points

## Overtime

Overtime occurs if a quiz ends in a tie and the team placements (1st, 2nd, 3rd) matter.

- Additional units of 3 overtime questions each will be used until the tie is broken
- 2-team rules will apply in overtime if only 2 teams are involved
- All the numeric questions will be of a different question type

## Question Type Distribution

In the below table, any minimum or maximum variation between material seasons is indicated in a `Narrative/Epistle` format.

| Type Group      | Minimum | Maximum | Question Types       |
|-----------------|--------:|--------:|----------------------|
| Interrogative   |     8/9 |   14/16 | INT                  |
| Multiple Answer |       1 |       2 | MA                   |
| Reference       |       3 |     6/7 | CR, CVR, MACR, MACVR |
| Quote           |     2/3 |     3/4 | Q, Q2V               |
| Finish          |       3 |       4 | FT, FTN, FTV, F2V    |
| Situation       |     2/0 |     4/0 | SIT                  |

For a given Question Type:

- The minimum number of questions must be asked in question numerics 1-20, thus excluding any alphanumeric question numbers
- The maximum number of questions must not be exceeded in all "non-overtime" questions. this includes both numeric-only and alphanumeric question numbers

For 15-question quizzes, prepare quizzes as normal for 20-question quizzes, but the quizmaster should conclude the quiz when appropriate for the rule of a 15-question quiz.

## Platform Protocol

- Quizzers will be seated facing the audience and quizmaster.
- The feet of the quizzers are to be on the floor while jumping.
- A line-up card showing the seating order of each quizzer should be given to the quizmaster or scorekeeper before the start of each quiz.
- No verbal or non-verbal communication is permitted between quizzers, coaches, or the audience from the time the quizmaster introduces the question type until points have been awarded.
- Only a coach from a team presently participating in the quiz or the meet director may confer with the officials.
- Coaches may have quiz material(s) on the platform during a timeout or prior to a quiz.
- Quizzers will not touch the officials' table.
- Quiz rooms will use jump measuring equipment to prevent ties.
- Push-button quizzing can be provided if needed by physically disabled quizzers.

## Jumping

- Quizzers have 5 seconds in which to jump after the quizmaster finishes reading the question.
- If a quizzer's light comes on after a question has been called and before the question has discernibly begun, a foul will be called.
- If a quizzer's light comes on after the quizmaster has discernibly begun reading the question, this will be considered a valid jump, and the quizzer will be given an opportunity to answer.
- The 1st quizzer to rise and trigger their light, provided there has been no foul, will be awarded the jump.
- If in the judgment of the officials, a deliberate attempt is made to forfeit a question, an error will be charged, and 10 points deducted from the team score. The next question will be the same question number.

## Timeliness

Except for the exception below:

- Quizzes will start at the scheduled or announced time.
- Any team that is late does not receive the starting 20 points awarded for being on time.
- Any team more than 10 minutes late forfeits the quiz.

The exception to the above is if the late team was late due to quizzing in another location which is running late, they are not required to forfeit the quiz or lose 20 points.

If any number of members of a team is late, the quiz will start on time.

Prior to the start of a quiz, if not all quizzers are in the room, 1 of 2 options exist for the team's coach:

1. Either the coach submits a lineup with the quizzer missing, which means the late-arriving quizzer cannot be subbed-in
2. Or the coach submits a lineup with the quizzer added, tells all the officials and coaches the quizzer is late, and loses the 20 starting points

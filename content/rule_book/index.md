# Bible Quizzing Rule Book

Bible Quizzing is a Christian sport in which teams of participants compete on Bible memorization in a context that requires a combination of speed, accuracy, and strategy and a culture that inspires collaboration, fellowship, and mutual encouragement. Bible Quizzing competitions, called meets, consist of a series of quizzes. Meets are grouped into quiz seasons, which typically run from late summer or early fall through late spring or early summer.

This is the official rule book for Bible Quizzing, which represents what will be followed at the annual *International Bible Quizzing* (IBQ) championship meet at the end of a quiz season. It is also a recommendational document for Quizzing districts and any other organizations interested in Bible Quizzing. These districts and other organizations retain the right to set and enforce their own rules using whatever mechanisms they deem most appropriate.

## Special Sections

There are some special section blocks within this rule book that contain content that are not rules. These special sections are included for a variety of reasons to aid in using the rule book. Some or all of the special sections can be and often are omitted when this rule book is published in simplified form. This specific publication of the rule book contains the following sections.

### Terms

There are several terms used throughout the rule book that are explicitly defined by a term/definition entry. They appear like this:

**Term**
: Definition

The definitions help clarify specific concepts related to the rules.

### Examples

Examples are a representation and tangible illustration of a rule. Since rules are often stated using abstract wording and concepts in generalized forms, it can be hard to visualize the rule's application without an example.

That said, each example is just 1 representation. Examples do not aim to exemplify every possible application of the rule. The fact that a lone example covers only part of the rule should not be interpreted as implying that the rule is actually different than stated. The correct interpretation should be that examples do not fully cover every application of the rule.

### Commentary

Commentary sections include a series of comments, explanations, or annotations about the preceding portion of the rule book. These sections contain notes about the reasoning of rule book sections or their philosophical and practical implications. They are not to be considered rules. Rather, they are mini-essays about the rules.

### Logic

There are components within this document that contain logic in the form of *English Script* (ES). ES is a simplified programming language that reads like plain English. The rule book uses ES to explicitly describe rules that can be consumed automatically by software directly from the rule book. For more information, see:

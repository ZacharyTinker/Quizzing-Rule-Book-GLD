# Roles and Responsibilities

## Team Organization

A team can consist of up to 5 quizzers. Teams can have up to 4 quizzers seated in a quiz at any given time.

### Captains

Scorekeepers must be notified which quizzer is the captain and which is co-captain before the quizzers take their seats to begin the quiz. The captain and co-captain may change during a given competition but not during a quiz.

Only the captain or co-captain may challenge a decision or respond to a challenge. If both the captain and co-captain have erred-out, another quizzer can be designated by the coach to respond to or initiate challenges.

## Quiz Officials

No comment other than "correct" or "incorrect" need be announced by the quiz officials when announcing a ruling; however, at the discretion of the *quizmaster* (QM) and *answer judge* (AJ), or at the request of the captain, additional information may be given.

If the additional information regarding the ruling is provided at the discretion of the QM/AJ and not at the request of the captain, this is not considered an explanation of a ruling, which would invalidate a challenge or protest.

If the captain requests additional information regarding the ruling, this is considered an explanation of a ruling and invalidates a challenge or protest. Before replying to a request for an explanation, the QM must ask all teams if they wish to challenge.

All conferring between quizmaster and answer judge(s) shall be done privately.

### Quizmasters (QM)

The quizmaster must:

- Maintain a position such that all currently seated quizzers are able to view the quizmaster's face
- Speak in such as a way to be understood by all quizzers
- Rule immediately upon an obviously correct or incorrect answer if there is no indication from the answer judge to the contrary

When a quizzer's response contains a required completion of the question and that completion is different than the written question, the quizmaster will discuss it with the answer judge. If the quizzer gives a reference question that is different than the written question, the quizmaster and answer judge must ensure that the reference question given is the exact same type as the written question.

The quizmaster should consult with the answer judge(s) at any time they feel is necessary, provided it does not infringe upon the quizzer's answering period.

#### Quizmaster Prompts

During the answering period, the quizmaster will use only the following prompts.

##### Pronoun Clarification

If a quizzer has provided all the information in the answer, except the identification of a pronoun present which is part of the answer text, the quizmaster will ask the quizzer to identify the specific pronoun. For example: "Can you identify 'He'?" or "Can you identify 'They'?"

The quizmaster is not allowed to say anything other than what the quizzer has already said when asking for the identification. A pronoun may need to be identified only if the antecedent is in context.

Once the quizzer has provided all information in the question and answer, the quizmaster will prompt the quizzer to identify the specific pronoun.

##### Reference Questions

On a Reference type question, if the quizzer has given all the information in both the question and the answer and the complete question was not read, the quizmaster will ask, "What is your question?"

##### Answer Correction

On a quote/finish type question, once the quizzer has quoted to the end of the required verse or verses, if the answer is not yet word-perfect, the quizmaster will say, "Again." This will occur as often as needed until the quizzer's answer is word-perfect or the answering period expires. The quizmaster is not allowed to say "again" until the quizzer has come to the end of the verse, each time through, as this would give the quizzer information about where their mistake was made.

For all other question types, once all of the information in both the question and answer has been given, but something needs to be fixed, the quizmaster will say "Again".

##### Quote is Complete

On a Situation type question, when the quizzer has completed the quotation, the quizmaster will say, "Quote is complete."

##### Appending an Answer

On an INT or MA question, if all the information in the answer text has been given but the quizzer is missing information in the question text, the quizmaster will say "More".

On a Situation question, because the quotation is part of the question, the quizmaster will say "More" when required information from the quotation is missing.

On a Quote or Reference question, if either the chapter or verse number were not completely finished when the quizzer jumped, the quizmaster will say "More".

#### Commentary

On a CVR/MACVR, in the scenario where the entire reference (which is part of the question text) was not read by the quizmaster, the quizmaster has 2 prompts to give, and must give them in correct order and with correct timing. If the quizzer provides all information in the question text and the answer text, because the quizzer has not yet finished saying the complete reference, which is part of the question, the quizmaster must prompt with "More." The quizmaster cannot prompt with "What is your question?" yet, because the quizzer has not provided all information in the question (which includes the reference) and the answer.

### Answer Judges (AJ)

When an answer given is in question, the answer judge will determine whether the answer given meets the requirements of a correct answer and make a ruling recommendation to the quizmaster.

Answer judges will also:

- Watch the quizmaster's reading for accuracy
- Ensure the quizzer is recognized by the quizmaster when their light comes on

### Scorekeepers (SK)

The scorekeeper will:

- Tally and immediately announce when a quizzer has erred-out, quizzed-out, or fouled-out
- Keep a record of all timeouts
- Keep a record of the number of questions a substitute quizzer has remained out to determine eligibility for re-substitution
- Either read the score or have the score ready to be read at the beginning of timeouts when there is no scoreboard
- Have the scoresheets signed by the coaches at the conclusion of each quiz and report to the statistician

### Statisticians (ST)

The statistician will be responsible for:

- Keeping individual quizzers' scores
- Keeping individual teams' scores
